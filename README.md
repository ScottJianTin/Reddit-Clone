Bubble is a no-code tool that let you build Saas platforms, marketplaces and CRMs without code. with Bubble, you can create interactive, multi-user apps for desktop and mobile web browsers and include all the tools you need to build a side like Facebook or Airbnb. By drag and drop, you can build out tons of logic and determine what happens as user navigate your application, click by click.

In this project, I built a Reddit Clone (online community platform) using Bubble's visual web editor. The steps to build a Reddit clone with no code include:
1) Building workflows
2) Creating subreddits
3) Displaying dynamic content on home page
4) Creating upvotes
5) Searching for subreddits
6) Displaying dynamic content on pages
7) Joining a subreddit
8) Creating a post
9) Displaying & viewing posts
10) Commenting on posts

Possible additional features:
1) Threaded comments
2) Send messages between users
3) Public user profiles, displaying a list of each users activity
4) Add karma points for each action across the platform
